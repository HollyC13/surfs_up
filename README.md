- Minimum December temperature, 56 degrees, may be considered too cold for surfing by individuals with recreational surfing interests.
- However, our data shows a December mean temperature of 71 degrees, suitable for both surfing and eating ice cream, illustrating the impact of the occasional "cold" December day should be limited.
- Data shows June temperatures to be consistently ideal for surfing and enjoying ice cream.


## Summary
Data indicates there will be a few "cold" days each December.  Collection of temperatures throughout the day, rather than once daily, could confirm if these are "cold" mornings followed by sufficiently warm afternoons.  An additional item to consider is precipitation, which tends to keep people indoors.  The following data has been analyzed to assist in evaluation of precipitation levels.

Analysis of precipitation at specific stations, as well as time of day precipitation occurs, could provide additional insight.
